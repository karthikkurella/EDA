"# The agency is interested to know if population wealth is an indicator of per capita COVID cases and deaths, death rate from confirmed cases, rate of change of these factors, and spread to adjacent principalities. At both the state and county levels, local governments could better prepare, warn citizens, and tighten recommended and/or required preventative measures One hypothesis, among many, is that population demographics related to wealth might provide insight into COVID-19 spread. Machine Learning algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM (Linear Kernel), KNN. But there are some inconsistencies that are to be taken care while classifying. One of them includes several features present in the dataset. The work have used PCA analysis to under the level of feature extraction, mutate columns and aggregate to make more reliable features. This analysis is focused on one of the questions: is population wealth an indicator of death rate from confirmed COVID cases. "
